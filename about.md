# Who am I to Myself?

![myface](https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12063434_10204282048726475_7634428386806909401_n.jpg?oh=3b2305e57e939415540849b0c7d3758a&oe=5AB2B525 "Thanks Facebook, for hosting pictures."){:height="300px" width="300px"}

So yeah that's me in that picture. I'm a pretty normal guy in my opinion. Also, a slight introvert; but not because I am shy, instead I am not generally that interested in other people. I like to focus on my own achievement and future goals making it hard to have a conversation instead of a monolog with people. Although I have improved in this areas quite a bit, I still need to continue improving my social interaction skills.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now lets get into details. From an intelligence perspective I feel my peers often over-estimate my abilities. I have good knowledge of a wide variety of topics but the reality is that my understanding is only baseline. The variety often overshadows my actual extent of knowledge. Although I think that perception is a good thing as it forces me to learn more when it comes into question. The figure of speech "a jack of all trades, master of none" truly does apply to me. Although I do 'hope' after my college education I can claim to be the master of something.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Those were pretty specific things to put down on the about page, but I feel that's the way it should be. Obviously this not everything I think about myself but I should be enough to give you some perspective. For all those who feel I am full of myself; that might be true. What I type is not always fact or unbiased. It's just what comes to my head, so take it for what it is.
