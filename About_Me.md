About Me
===

## Who am I?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So yeah that's me in that picture. I'm a pretty normal guy in my opinion. Also, a slight introvert; but not because I am shy, instead I am not generally that interested in other people. I like to focus on my own achievement and future goals making it hard to have a conversation instead of a monolog with people. Although I have improved in this areas quite a bit, I still need to continue improving my social interaction skills.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now lets get into details. From an intelligence perspective I feel my peers often over-estimate my abilities. I have good knowledge of a wide variety of topics but the reality is that my understanding is only baseline. The variety often overshadows my actual extent of knowledge. Although I think that perception is a good thing as it forces me to learn more when it comes into question. The figure of speech "a jack of all trades, master of none" truly does apply to me. Although I do 'hope' after my college education I can claim to be the master of something.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Those were pretty specific things to put down on the about page, but I feel that's the way it should be. Obviously this not everything I think about myself but I should be enough to give you some perspective. For all those who feel I am full of myself; that might be true. What I type is not always fact or unbiased. It's just what comes to my head, so take it for what it is.

## My life in a Nutshell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lets make this a sequence of events. *Sheldon Cooper:* 'According to many studies past memory can often be flawed or false. We remember things the way we would have wanted it to play out.'

### Birth on 23 December on 1996 in B.S.P Hospital, Bhilai, Chattisgarh, India.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This part of my life was quite interesting. I am very happy that I spent a portion of life in a joint family. I had absolutely no need for friends as I had enough cousins around me to play with. Although, I do have to say that I glad that my parents had the courage to leave this small town and go where opportunity took them. I use to hate is as a kid, moving from place to place, but now I appreciate the experience it gave me. It also allowed me to dream bigger and aim higher. That being said I do see myself coming back to Bhilai if an opportunity presents itself.

### Places I have Visited and/or called Home.

I think traveling is something I can claim to have some experience in. I haven't seen the world but I have been around. One thing that I love about traveling is experiencing new cultures and technologies. You experience different cuisines, architecture, norms and social interactions. Some of my favorite things to do is to eat at local restaurants to experience the food the average person eats. Use public transport to get to know the personality of a place. And finally visit Museums to learn about the place's historical significance and technological advances.

### High School Years in Dubai, UAE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
High School was by far the best part of my life. Its had its ups and downs but it made me a better person and gave me some definitive direction in life. I also learned to have a little fun and enjoy myself. I experienced everything; getting bad grades, bunking classes, getting into fights, playing sports, partying, working on projects, perusing my crush, sleepovers and some studying.

### College in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am in College right now so I don't have a whole lot to recollect. In a nutshell, I am doing pretty good at college and like any other college students I am trying to figure out where I wanna take my life. In the mean time I occasionally try to enjoy myself and experience new things and meet new people.
